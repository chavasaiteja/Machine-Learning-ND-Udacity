### Datasets
* Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip). Unzip the folder and place it at location path/to/dog-project/dogImages. The dogImages/ folder should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.
* Download the [human dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz). Unzip the folder and place it at location path/to/dog-project/lfw. If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use 7zip to extract the folder.
